    <p>
This course focuses on two main topics: The basics of organizing data for
efficient computation, and how to design programs with classes and interfaces.
    </p>

    <p>

Each week, we will explore topics in these areas interactively during lectures.
You will read beyond what we explore in lecture, complete programming
assignments to hone your coding and program design skills, and take exams that
test your understanding of what you've learned. After, you'll be better at
designing and understanding programs and the structure of data they work
over.

    <a id="staff">
    <h2>Staff &amp; Resources</h2>

    <p>The course is largely run by a talented team of graduate and
    undergraduate students:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Sakshi Shah</li>
    <li>Anisha Motwani</li>
    <li>Michael Barrow</li>
    <li>Tina Chen</li>
    <li>Nik Sankar</li>

    <li>Miranda Go</li>
    <li>Yimeng Yang</li>
    <li><a href = "http://www.arkin.xyz"> Arkin Gupta </a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>We all work together to staff help sessions in the labs located in the
    basement of the CSE building. A detailed lab schedule will be posted during
    the first week.</p>

    <p>Joe has in-person open office hours on <em>Thursday</em>, from
    2:30pm-4pm, and <em>Monday</em> from 11am-12pm, in CSE 3206. Go there for
    questions about research, careers, help beyond programming assignments,
    topics beyond the course, or anything else you want to discuss. There will
    be an announcement if these move for any reason.</p>

    <h3>Lab Hours</h3>

    <p>
    There are a number of lab hours provided for you to get help from the staff
    in person. There is a queueing system called Autograder that you can use to
    request help at your workstation. The hours schedule is below:
    </p>
    <iframe width=125% height="500px" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQOtC0fB5I_zbYk3FcTZwTGhyQIPcG5GF0dUZKymRnxyywDRAnGK2ss4Ws_48xbNI8JbNw0lORnaqGB/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>
    
    <p>
    Note that on Wednesday, the night the assignment is due, we cut off hours
    roughly 6 hours before the deadline. We'll stop giving help on the
    assignment at that point, so make use of the generous hours available
    Sunday through Tuesday to get work done early.
    </p>

    <p>
    The point of lab hours is to get you un-stuck when you're not sure what to
    do next on an assignment. The job of a tutor in lab hours is <b>not</b>
    necessarily to solve the problem you asked. The job of the tutor is to make
    sure you have the knowledge you need to take a productive next step. That
    means if you ask for help because you don't know how to implement the next
    method, you should expect that when the tutor leaves you know how to take a
    first step towards that implementation. You might end up with an idea for
    simple examples to try first, or a picture that demonstrates a good
    approach, or some other guide that isn't concrete code. The problem won't
    be solved, but you will be un-stuck.
    </p>

    <p>
    When you ask a question on Autograder, a few guidelines:

    <ul>

    <li>Give a meaningful question or problem statement in your ticket. It
    doesn't need to be long, but it should be possible for a tutor to imagine
    possible situations just from the ticket, and not have to get the full
    story when arriving at your workstation. For tickets without meaningful
    questions, tutors are free to use their judgment to remove them from the
    queue.</li>

    <li>Be prepared! When the tutor shows up, you should be ready to reproduce
    the issue you're having, have a test case that doesn't produce the right
    output, show them a drawing of the situation you're confused about,
    etc.</li>

    </ul>
    </p>


    <h3>Piazza</h3>

    <p>You can and should ask questions on Piazza. We have some guidelines and
    advice for doing so.</p>

    <p>The default on our Piazza board is for questions to be private to the
    question asker and the instructors. We (the instructional staff) will often
    make private questions public if we think the answers and discussion will
    be useful to everyone<del>; if we do so we'll switch the author visibility
    to anonymous</del> (it turns out it's not possible to make it anonymous if
    the original post isn't anonymous). If you want to be anonymous when a post
    is publicized, please set it to anonymous initially. Note that we won't
    publicize obviously-private questions about grades or other sensitive
    topics. If you want to ask a private question that stays private, just ask
    us to keep it private in the body of the question.</p>

    <p>You are also welcome to ask and answer public questions! Before you do,
    consider:

    <ul>
    <li>Does it contribute to a positive, constructive, and respectful forum for discussion and learning?</li>
    <li>Does it contain contain source code or other information that shouldn't be shared class-wide?</li>
    <li>Is it a question that's been asked before, that you could find via searching?</li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <p>If you make a post that violates these guidelines, we may make it
    private and remind you of these guidelines.  Overall, our goal is to make
    the public content on Piazza constructive and relevant for everyone.</p>

    <p>In your question, clearly indicate the problem you're having or question
    you need answered, and feel free to share any supporting code or
    screenshots that may help us understand what's going on. If it's a simple
    technical issue or clarification, you might get a direct answer. If it's a
    question about an assignment, expect to get questions back that lead you
    towards a better understanding, not an immediate answer that solves your
    problem.</p>

    <p>We will, for each assignment, aggregate together a frequently asked
    questions post that draws from questions we receive in office hours and via
    Piazza posts. If you ask a question that's already answered in that post,
    we'll likely just send you a link to that post. That post will be updated
    as new important questions and answers come in.</p>

    <p>For public discussion, note that answers from your classmates are not
    official. They could be downright wrong or misleading, completely by
    accident. “My classmate said so on Piazza” is not a legitimate
    justification in most arguments, though they may indeed lead you in helpful
    directions.</p>

    <p>Finally, a note about the pedagogic value of communication – a huge
    amount of modern computer science happens via collaboration, in text,
    online. Sites like Stack Overflow and Github hold incredible wealths of
    information generated through asking and answering questions. Computer
    science research, large system development, and cutting-edge design happens
    through professional, high-volume mailing lists. Practicing using Piazza
    professionally prepares you for these situations, so do it mindfully.</p>

    <h3>Discussion Sections</h3>

    <p>
    There is a discussion section corresponding to each lecture. Discussions
    will focus on interactive activities that go along with programming
    assignments. This might include techniques for more effective development
    during programming assignments, conceptual problems about the assignment
    itself, a demonstration of a particularly tricky part of the assignment,
    and more. Attendance may be taken but doesn't have a direct impact on your
    grade, though there may be ways to make up clicker participation points
    provided through discussion section attendance.
    </p>


    <h3>The IDEA Engineering Student Center</h3>
    
    <p>The IDEA Engineering Student Center, located just off the lobby of
    Jacobs Hall, is a hub for student engagement, academic enrichment,
    personal/professional development, leadership, community involvement, and a
    respectful learning environment for all. The Center offers a variety of
    programs, listed in the IDEA Center Facebook page at
    http://www.facebook.com/ucsdidea/ and the Center web site at
    http://idea.ucsd.edu/. The IDEA Center programs support both undergraduate
    students and graduate students.
    </p>


    <a id="grading">
    <h2>Grading</h2>

    <p>There are 100 points you can earn in the course.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>5 participation via clickers. You must bring a clicker to class to
    answer, and have four allowed absences. You get credit for each lecture in
    which you give an answer for at least half the questions.</li>

    <li>10 reading activities/quizzes. There will be various activities
    associated with the readings each week, that may differ from week to week.
    These will be made clear in the schedule.</li>

    <li>40 for programming assignments
      <ul>
        <li>4% each for PA1, PA3, PA5, PA7</li>
        <li>6% each for PA2, PA4, PA6, PA8</li>
      </ul>
    
    </li>
      
    <li>45 exams
      <ul>
      <li>25 in-class exams (10 for lower score, 15 for higher score)</li>
      <li>20 final exam</li>
      </ul>
      Update:
      If your final exam score is higher than the lower midterm score, your
      final exam score replaces that 10 points of your exam points. This also
      serves as the missed exam and makeup in-class exam policy (since a 0 will
      be given for a missed in-class exam), and no alternative or makeup midterm
      exam times will be offered. For example, if you get between 0% and 59% on
      the first midterm, 60% on the second, and 80% on the final, your total
      exam points would be (0.6 * 15) + (0.8 * (10 + 20)) = 33.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Point totals will be transformed to letters by the mapping below (a
    square bracket indicates <em>inclusive</em> and a parenthesis indicates
    <em>exclusive</em>).  Thresholds may be lowered at the instructor's
    discretion but will not be raised, and never for individual students, only
    for the whole class. Historically, requests for changes to the thresholds
    have hardened the instructor's heart for the duration of the quarter, and
    made them less likely to happen.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>[99,100]: A+</li>
    <li>[93-99): A</li>
    <li>[90-93): A-</li>
    <li>[87-90): B+</li>
    <li>[83-87): B</li>
    <li>[80-83): B-</li>
    <li>[77-80): C+</li>
    <li>[73-77): C</li>
    <li>[70-73): C-</li>
    <li>[60-70): D</li>
    <li>[0-60): F</li>
    </ul>

    <a id="policies"></a>
    <h2>Policies</h2>

    <h3>Sections</h3>

    <p>This quarter there are 3 sections of CSE 12. This course page does not
    pertain to the content of A section, only to B and C section.</p>

    <h3>Late Work</h3>

    <p>You can hand in programming assignments up to 24 hours late for a 20%
    deduction. After that no credit will be given. Contact the instructor for
    documented extenuating circumstances.</p>

    <h3>Regrades</h3>

    <p>Mistakes sometimes occur in grading. Once grades are posted, we will
    allow a short period for you to request a fix to your grade (announced
    along with the release of grades), with a sufficient argument for why a
    mistake was made. If you don't make a request in the given period, the
    grade you were initially given is final.</p>

    <h3>Exams</h3>

    <p>You are not allowed any study aids on exams (aside from those pertaining
    to university-approved academic accommodations). Reference sheets will be
    provided along with exams to avoid unnecessary memorization.</p>


    <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

    <p>Acting with academic integrity in this course means that you do your own
    learning and are evaluated on your own work.</p>

    <p>The first week has a form to fill out that asks you to read and
    understand this <a
    href="https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/forms/form-scholarship-agreement.html">scholarship
    agreement</a> (you don't submit the form at that link, it just has a useful
    description), and to take this <a
    href="http://libraries.ucsd.edu/assets/elearning/cse/cseplagiarismlink/story_html5.html">code
    plagiarism tutorial</a>. These should cover what violations look like for
    this course; feel free to ask if you have any questions about a situation
    you are unsure about.</p>

    <h3>Consent to Participate in Educational Research</h3>

    <p>
    <em>Investigating the Impact of Pedagogical Choices on University Student Learning and Engagement</em></p>

    <p><b>Who is conducting the study, why you have been asked to participate, how
    you were selected, and what is the approximate number of participants in the
    study?  </b></p>

    <p>Gabriele Wienhausen, Director of the Teaching and Learning Commons,
    together with her education research colleagues is conducting a research
    study to find out more about how pedagogical choices affect student
    learning and experience in the classroom. You have been asked to
    participate in this study because you are a student in a class that is
    being studied or used as a control. There will be approximately 500,000
    participants in this study.  </p>




    <p><b>Why is this study being done?</b></p>

    <p>The purpose of this study is to create knowledge that has the potential
    to improve the learning and educational experience of students at UC San
    Diego and beyond.</p>

    <p></b>What will happen to you in this study and which procedures are
    standard of care and which are experimental?</b></p>

    <p>
    If you agree to be in this study, the following will happen:
    </p>

    <p>Your data from this class including grades, homework and exam
    submissions, and survey responses will be included in the analysis to
    determine the effectiveness of the pedagogical techniques used in this
    course compared to other similar courses.</p>

    <p><b>How much time will each study procedure take, what is your total time
    commitment, and how long will the study last?</b></p>

    <p>Your participation involves only agreeing to let us use your data in our
    analysis.  It will require no time on your part above the time you put into
    this course without agreeing to the study.</p>

    <p><b>What risks are associated with this study?</b></p>

    <p>Participation in this study may involve some added risks or discomforts.
    These include the following:</p>

    <ol> <li>A potential for the loss of confidentiality.   We will not share your
    personally identifying data with people outside our research team.  Data will
    only be kept in anonymized form for research purposes.  Course data will not
    used for this research study until after final grades have been posted and will
    be rendered confidential by removing any identifiers before analysis.  Your
    instructor will not know whether or not you are participating in this study
    until after final grades have been posted.  Data from students who opt out of
    the study will be removed prior to data analysis.  Research records will be
    kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. Research records may be
    reviewed by the UCSD Institutional Review Board.  </li></ol>

    <p> Since this is an investigational study, there may be some unknown risks
    that are currently unforeseeable. You will be informed of any significant new
    findings.  </p>


    <p><b>What are the alternatives to participating in this study?</b></p>


    <p>The alternatives to participation in this study are not to participate.
    If you choose to opt-out of participating in this research study, we will
    exclude your data from analysis.  Whether you participate will have no
    impact on your experience or grade in the associated class as the professor
    will not know who is or is not participating in the study until after final
    grades are assigned.</p>

    <p><b>What benefits can be reasonably expected?</b></p>

    <p>There is no direct benefit to you for participating in the study. The
    investigator, however, may learn more about how to improve student
    learning, and society may benefit from this knowledge.</p>

    <p><b>Can you choose to not participate or withdraw from the study without
    penalty or loss of benefits?</b></p>

    <p> Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may refuse to
    participate or withdraw or refuse to answer specific questions in an
    interview or on a questionnaire at any time without penalty or loss of
    benefits to which you are entitled. If you decide that you no longer wish
    to continue in this study before the end of the quarter, simply respond to
    the online opt-out form here: <a
    href="https://goo.gl/forms/JSBRjEmkES6W6xYc2">https://goo.gl/forms/JSBRjEmkES6W6xYc2</a>.
