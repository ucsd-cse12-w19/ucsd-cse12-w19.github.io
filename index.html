    <p>
This course focuses on two main topics: The basics of organizing data for
efficient computation, and how to design programs that use collections,
classes, and interfaces.
    </p>

    <p>

Each week, we will explore topics in these areas interactively during lectures.
You will read beyond what we explore in lecture, complete programming
assignments to hone your coding and program design skills, and take exams that
test your understanding of what you've learned. After, you'll be better at
designing and understanding programs and the structure of data they work
over.

    <em>Investigating the Impact of Pedagogical Choices on University Student Learning and Engagement</em></p>

    <p><b>Who is conducting the study, why you have been asked to participate, how
    you were selected, and what is the approximate number of participants in the
    study?  </b></p>

    <p>Gabriele Wienhausen, Director of the Teaching and Learning Commons,
    together with her education research colleagues is conducting a research
    study to find out more about how pedagogical choices affect student
    learning and experience in the classroom. You have been asked to
    participate in this study because you are a student in a class that is
    being studied or used as a control. There will be approximately 500,000
    participants in this study.  </p>




    <p><b>Why is this study being done?</b></p>

    <p>The purpose of this study is to create knowledge that has the potential
    to improve the learning and educational experience of students at UC San
    Diego and beyond.</p>

    <p></b>What will happen to you in this study and which procedures are
    standard of care and which are experimental?</b></p>

    <p>
    If you agree to be in this study, the following will happen:
    </p>

    <p>Your data from this class including grades, homework and exam
    submissions, and survey responses will be included in the analysis to
    determine the effectiveness of the pedagogical techniques used in this
    course compared to other similar courses.</p>

    <p><b>How much time will each study procedure take, what is your total time
    commitment, and how long will the study last?</b></p>

    <p>Your participation involves only agreeing to let us use your data in our
    analysis.  It will require no time on your part above the time you put into
    this course without agreeing to the study.</p>

    <p><b>What risks are associated with this study?</b></p>

    <p>Participation in this study may involve some added risks or discomforts.
    These include the following:</p>

    <ol> <li>A potential for the loss of confidentiality.   We will not share your
    personally identifying data with people outside our research team.  Data will
    only be kept in anonymized form for research purposes.  Course data will not
    used for this research study until after final grades have been posted and will
    be rendered confidential by removing any identifiers before analysis.  Your
    instructor will not know whether or not you are participating in this study
    until after final grades have been posted.  Data from students who opt out of
    the study will be removed prior to data analysis.  Research records will be
    kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. Research records may be
    reviewed by the UCSD Institutional Review Board.  </li></ol>

    <p> Since this is an investigational study, there may be some unknown risks
    that are currently unforeseeable. You will be informed of any significant new
    findings.  </p>


    <p><b>What are the alternatives to participating in this study?</b></p>


    <p>The alternatives to participation in this study are not to participate.
    If you choose to opt-out of participating in this research study, we will
    exclude your data from analysis.  Whether you participate will have no
    impact on your experience or grade in the associated class as the professor
    will not know who is or is not participating in the study until after final
    grades are assigned.</p>

    <p><b>What benefits can be reasonably expected?</b></p>

    <p>There is no direct benefit to you for participating in the study. The
    investigator, however, may learn more about how to improve student
    learning, and society may benefit from this knowledge.</p>

    <p><b>Can you choose to not participate or withdraw from the study without
    penalty or loss of benefits?</b></p>

    <p> Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may refuse to
    participate or withdraw or refuse to answer specific questions in an
    interview or on a questionnaire at any time without penalty or loss of
    benefits to which you are entitled. If you decide that you no longer wish
    to continue in this study before the end of the quarter, simply respond to
    the online opt-out form here: <a
    href="https://goo.gl/forms/JSBRjEmkES6W6xYc2">https://goo.gl/forms/JSBRjEmkES6W6xYc2</a>.
    If you decide to opt out after the quarter has ended, you must contact Ying
    Xiong (yix184@ucsd.edu) and give the quarter and the course from which you
    would like your data withdrawn.</p>

    <p>You will be told if any important new information is found during the
    course of this study that may affect your wanting to continue.</p>

    <p><b>Can you be withdrawn from the study without your consent?</b><p>

    <p> The PI may remove you from the study without your consent if the PI feels
    it is in your best interest or the best interest of the study. You may also be
    withdrawn from the study if you do not follow the instructions given you by the
    study personnel.</p>

    <p><b>Will you be compensated for participating in this study?</b><p>

    <p>You will not be compensated for participating in this study.</p>

    <p><b>Are there any costs associated with participating in this study?</b><p>

    <p>There will be no cost to you for participating in this study.</p>

    <p><b>Who can you call if you have questions?</b><p>

    <p>Gabriele Wienhausen and/or her colleague has explained this study to you and
    answered your questions. If you have other questions or research-related
    problems, you may reach Gabriele Wienhausen at gwienhausen@ucsd.edu or (858)
    534-3958.</p>


    <p>You may call the Human Research Protections Program Office at
    858-246-HRPP (858-246-4777) to inquire about your rights as a research
    subject or to report research-related problems.</p>

    <p><b>Your Consent</b><p>

    If you consent to participate in this study and are at least 18 years old,
    no action is needed.  If you DO NOT consent to participate in this study,
    or you choose to opt-out at any time during the quarter, please submit this
